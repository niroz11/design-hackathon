# Static Composition 1

## Project Description
> The static comp challenge is a series of three challenges to keep working that HTML/CSS. We were asked to recreate a static comp. The objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design and expand upon the copy, images and colors.

## Built With
This project was build with the following
- HTML
- CSS

## Practice Description
> In this project we practiced using flex boxes to really make a responsive design with very little media queries

## Target User 
> We create this design for Gladys Schvitz who is in her 70's with a family of 6 kids and 12 grandkids. She lives in El paso, texas and she is quite a character. As Gladys is a senior citizen, we tried to make the design as visual as possible so that she can use her fitness tracker seamlessly. Gladys takes her health seriously and she is always on top of keeping herself up to date with her progress. She can view her daily achievements in the action log section and she can set daily goals in daily goals section. To make daily logs and daily actions more visual, we added images to keep track of her daily drinking, medical and physical intimacy needs.
